Typescript is 2 things:
• Type checker , develops an understanding of all the construct and let know if is set up incorrectly
• Compiler , program that runs the type checker , report any issues then outputs the equivalent JS code

implicit vs explicit:
implicit , often but not described clearly or directly, and often using implication or assumption.
explicit , describes something that is very clear and without vagueness or ambiguity.
